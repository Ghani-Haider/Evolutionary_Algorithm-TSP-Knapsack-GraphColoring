# Evolutionary Algorithm: Problem Set TSP, Knapsack and GraphColoring

Stochastic optimization using Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) to address some known computing problems that map to several real-world problems and are known to be computationally hard which are given below:

- Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) [Dataset](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html)
- Knapsack Problem [Dataset](http://artemisa.unicauca.edu.co/~johnyortega/instances_01_KP/)
- Graph coloring [Dataset](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/files/)
